# HR Management System

This project is an ongoing development of an HR management system aimed at streamlining human resource processes. The backend functionality is up and running, but the frontend and the connection between the frontend and backend still need some work. Below are the steps on how to get the system running on your local machine, followed by the new tooling discoveries, and challenges faced during development.
Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:
        Clone the repository to your local machine.

    Installation:
        Once the repo has been fully cloned, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

        css

    npm i

## Running the Backend:

    To get the backend running, use the following command:

    sql

    npm start

## Running the Frontend:

    To run the frontend, use the following command:

    arduino

        npm run dev

## Tooling Discoveries

During the development of this project, I discovered some useful package managers that enhanced the functionality and performance of the application:

    Lodash: This utility library helped in handling data more efficiently which in turn speed up the operations.

    Compression: This library allows data to be compressed when being called, which improved the performance of data retrieval.

## Challenges

The primary challenge faced during the development was the integration of the frontend and backend. Despite the backend being fully functional, connecting it to the frontend posed a significant hurdle. This is an area I am actively working on to resolve as the project progresses. Your contributions towards solving this challenge or any other enhancements are highly welcomed.
